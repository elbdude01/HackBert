# HackBert

This is the source for my self-made copy of the "HÃ¶rbert", a simple MP3 player
for kids. The project is described here:

I made small changes to the source code and wrote a simple shell script that
allows for preparing the SD card. It also converts the input files to WAV format
with a single channel and 22.050 kHz sample rate. That should lower the current
drain compared to playing MP3 files.
